    - **Breaking change** `filter_multiple` method is removed. `filter` method and `filteringExpressionsTree` property could be used instead.
    - **Breaking change** `filter` method has new signature. It now accepts the following parameters:
        - `name` - the name of the column to be filtered.
        - `value` - the value to be used for filtering.
        - `conditionOrExpressionTree` - (optional) this parameter accepts object of type `IFilteringOperation` or `IFilteringExpressionsTree`. If only a simple filtering is required a filtering operation could be passes (see bellow for more info). In case of advanced filtering an expressions tree containing complex filtering logic could be passed.
        - `ignoreCase` - (optional) - whether the filtering would be case sensitive or not.
    - **Breaking change** `onFilteringDone` event now have only one parameter - `IFilteringExpressionsTree` which contains the filtering state of the filtered column.
    - `filter_global` method clears all existing filters and applies the new filtering condition to all grid's columns.
    - filtering operands:
        - **Breaking change** `IFilteringExpression` condition property is no longer a direct reference to a filtering condition method, instead it's a reference to an `IFilteringOperation`
        - 5 filtering operand classes are now exposed
            - `IgxFilteringOperand` is a base filtering operand, which can be inherited when defining custom filtering conditions
            - `IgxBooleanFilteringOperand` defines all default filtering conditions for `boolean` types
            - `IgxNumberFilteringOperand` defines all default filtering conditions for `numeric` types
            - `IgxStringFilteringOperand` defines all default filtering conditions for `string` types
            - `IgxDateFilteringOperand` defines all default filtering conditions for `Date` types
        - `IgxColumnComponent` now exposes a `filters` property, which takes an `IgxFilteringOperand` class reference
            - Custom filters can now be provided to grid columns by populating the `operations` property of the `IgxFilteringOperand` with operations of `IFilteringOperation` type
```
export class IgxCustomFilteringOperand extends IgxFilteringOperand {
    // Making the implementation singleton
    private static _instance: IgxCustomFilteringOperand = null;

    protected constructor() {
        super();
        this.operations = [{
            name: 'custom',
            logic: (target: string) => {
                return target === 'My custom filter';
            }
        }].concat(this.operations); // Keep the empty and notEmpty conditions from base
    }

    // singleton
    // Must implement this method, because the IgxColumnComponent expects it
    public static instance(): IgxCustomFilteringOperand {
        return this._instance || (this._instance = new this());
    }
}
```

- `igxGrid` now supports grouping of columns enabling users to create criteria for organizing data records. To explore the functionality start off by setting some columns as `groupable`:
    ```html
    <igx-grid [data]="data">

            <p>Please wait, data is loading...</p>
        </ng-template>
    </igx-list>
    ```

- **Breaking changes**:
    - Removed submodule imports. All imports are now resolved from the top level `igniteui-angular` package.
    - `igxGrid` changes:

## 6.0.4
- **igxRadioGroup** directive introduced. It allows better control over its child `igxRadio` components and support template-driven and reactive forms.
- Fixed ReactiveForms validations support for IgxInputGroup. Related [issue](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/issues/1144).

## 6.0.3

## 6.0.2
- **igxGrid** Improve scrolling on mac [#1563](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/pull/1563)
- The `ng update igniteui-angular` migration schematics now also update the theme import path in SASS files. [#1582](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/issues/1582)

## 6.0.1
- Introduced migration schematics to integrate with the Angular CLI update command. You can now run

  `ng update igniteui-angular`

  in existing projects to both update the package and apply any migrations needed to your project. Make sure to commit project state before proceeding.
  Currently these cover converting submodule imports as well as the deprecation of `igxForRemote` and rename of `igx-tab-bar` to `igx-bottom-nav` from 6.0.0.
- **Breaking changes**:
    - Removed submodule imports. All imports are now resolved from the top level `igniteui-angular` package. You can use `ng update igniteui-angular` when updating to automatically convert existing submodule imports in the project.
    - Summary functions for each IgxSummaryOperand class has been made `static`. So now you can use them in the following way:
    ```typescript
    import { IgxNumberSummaryOperand, IgxSummaryOperand } from "igniteui-angular";
    class CustomSummary extends IgxSummaryOperand {
    constructor() {
      super();
    }
    public operate(data?: any[]) {
      const result = super.operate(data);
      result.push({
        key: "Min",
        label: "Min",
        summaryResult: IgxNumberSummaryOperand.min(data)
      });
      return result;
    }
  }
    ```


## 6.0.0

- Filtering a boolean column by `false` condition will return only the real `false` values, excluding `null` and `undefined`. Filtering by `Null` will return the `null` values and filtering by `Empty` will return the `undefined`.
- The `Filter` button in the filtering UI is replaced with a `Close` button that is always active and closes the UI.
- Filtering UI input displays a `X` icon that clears the input.

## 5.3.0
- Added `rowSelectable` property to `igxGrid`
    - Setting `rowSelectable` to `true` enables multiple row selection for the `igx-grid` component. Adds a checkbox column that allows (de)selection of one, multiple or all (via header checkbox) rows.
    - For more information about the `rowSelectable` property and working with grid row, please read the `igxGrid`'s [ReadMe](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/blob/master/src/grid/README.md) about selection or see the [official documentation](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid-selection.html)

    - `igx-tab-bar` selector is deprecated. Use `igx-bottom-nav` selector instead.
- `igx-tabs` component added
    - `igx-tabs` allows users to switch between different views. The `igx-tabs` component places the tabs headers at the top and allows scrolling when there are multiple tab items outside the visible area. Tabs are ordered in a single row above their associated content.
    - For more information navigate to [ReadMe](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/blob/master/src/tabs/README.md).
- Added column pinning in the list of features available for `igxGrid`. Pinning is available though the API. Try the following:
   ```typescript
   const column = this.grid.getColumnByName(name);
   column.pin();
   ```
   For more information, please head over to `igxGrid`'s [ReadMe](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/blob/master/src/grid/README.md) or the [official documentation](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid_column_pinning.html).
- Added `summaries` feature to `igxGrid`, enabled on a per-column level. **Grid summaries** gives you a predefined set of default summaries, depending on the type of data in the column.
    For more detailed information read `igxGrid`'s [ReadMe](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/blob/master/src/grid/README.md) or see the [official documentation](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid_summaries.html).
- Added `columnWidth` option to `igxGrid`. The option sets the default width that will be applied to columns that have no explicit width set. For more detailed information read `igxGrid`'s [ReadMe](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/blob/master/src/grid/README.md)
- Added API to `igxGrid` that allows for vertical remote virtualization. For guidance on how to implement such in your application, please refer to the [official documentation](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid_virtualization.html)
- Added smooth scrolling for the `igxForOf` directive making the scrolling experience both vertically and horizontally much more natural and similar to a native scroll.
- Added `onCellClick` event.
- `igxForOf` now requires that its parent container's `overflow` is set to `hidden` and `position` to `relative`. It is recommended that its height is set as well so that the display container of the virtualized content can be positioned with an offset inside without visually affecting other elements on the page.
    ```html
    <div style='position: relative; height: 500px; overflow: hidden'>
        <ng-template igxFor let-item [igxForOf]="data" #virtDirVertical
                [igxForScrollOrientation]="'vertical'"
                [igxForContainerSize]='"500px"'
                [igxForItemSize]='"50px"'
                let-rowIndex="index">
                <div style='height:50px;'>{{rowIndex}} : {{item.text}}</div>
        </ng-template>
    </div>
    ```
- Removed the `dirty` local template variable previously exposed by the `igxFor` directive.
- The `igxForRemote` input for the `igxFor` directive is now **deprecated**. Setting the required `totalItemCount` property after receiving the first data chunk is enough to trigger the required functionality.
- the `igx-icon` component can now work with both glyph and ligature-based icon font sets. We've also included a brand new Icon Service, which helps you create aliases for the icon fonts you've included in your project. The service also allows you to define the default icon set used throughout your app.
- Added the option to conditionally disable the `igx-ripple` directive through the `igxRippleDisabled` property.
- Updated styling and interaction animations of the `igx-checkbox`, `igx-switch`, and `igx-radio` components.
- Added `indeterminate` property and styling to the `igx-checkbox` component.
- Added `required` property to the `igx-checkbox`, `igx-radio`, and `igx-switch` components.
- Added `igx-ripple` effect to the `igx-checkbox`, `igx-switch`, and `igx-radio` components. The effect can be disabled through the `disableRipple` property.
- Added the ability to specify the label location in the `igx-checkbox`, `igx-switch`, and `igx-radio` components through the `labelPosition` property. It can either be `before` or `after`.
- You can now use any element as label on the `igx-checkbox`, `igx-switch`, and `igx-radio` components via the aria-labelledby property.
- You can now have invisible label on the `igx-checkbox`, `igx-switch`, and `igx-radio` components via the aria-label property.
- Added the ability to toggle the `igx-checkbox` and `igx-switch` checked state programmatically via `toggle` method on the component instance.
- Added the ability to select an `igx-radio` programmatically via `select` method on the component instance.
- Fixed a bug on the `igx-checkbox` and `igx-radio` components where the click event was being triggered twice on click.
- Fixed a bug where the `igx-checkbox`, `igx-switch`, and `igx-radio` change event was not being triggered on label click.
- `igxМask` directive added
    - `igxМask` provide means for controlling user input and formatting the visible value based on a configurable mask rules. For more detailed information see [`igxMask README file`](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/blob/master/src/directives/mask/README.md)
- `igxInputGroup` component added - used as a container for the `igxLabel`, `igxInput`, `igxPrefix`, `igxSuffix` and `igxHint` directives.
- `igxPrefix` directive added - used for input prefixes.
- `igxSuffix` directive added - used for input suffixes.
- `igxHint` directive added - used for input hints.
- `igxInput` directive breaking changes:
    - the directive should be wrapped by `igxInputGroup` component
    - `IgxInputGroupModule` should be imported instead of `IgxInputModule`
- `igxExcelExportService` and `igxCSVExportService` added. They add export capabilities to the `igxGrid`. For more information, please visit the [igxExcelExportService specification](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/wiki/IgxExcelExporterService-Specification) and the [igxCSVExportService specification](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/wiki/CSV-Exporter-Service-Specification).
- **General**
    - Added event argument types to all `EventEmitter` `@Output`s. #798 #740
    - Reviewed and added missing argument types to the following `EventEmitter`s
        - The `igxGrid` `onEditDone` now exposes arguments of type `IGridEditEventArgs`. The arguments expose `row` and `cell` objects where if the editing is performed on a cell, the edited `cell` and the `row` the cell belongs to are exposed. If row editing is performed, the `cell` object is null. In addition the `currentValue` and `newValue` arguments are exposed. If you assign a value to the `newValue` in your handler, then the editing will conclude with the value you've supplied.
        - The `igxGrid` `onSelection` now correctly propagates the original `event` in the `IGridCellEventArgs`.
    - Added `jsZip` as a Peer Dependency.
- `primaryKey` attribute added to `igxGrid`
    - `primaryKey` allows for a property name from the data source to be specified. If specified, `primaryKey` can be used instead of `index` to indentify grid rows from the `igxGrid.rowList`. As such, `primaryKey` can be used for selecting rows for the following `igxGrid` methods - `deleteRow`, `updateRow`, `updateCell`, `getCellByColumn`, `getRowByKey`
    - `primaryKey` requires all of the data for the specified property name to have unique values in order to function as expected.
    - as it provides a unique identifier for each data member (and therefore row), `primaryKey` is best suited for addressing grid row entries. If DOM virtualization is in place for the grid data, the row `index` property can be reused (for instance, when filtering/sorting the data), whereas `primaryKey` remains unique. Ideally, when a persistent reference to a row has to be established, `primaryKey` should be used.
- **Theming**
    - Added a `utilities` module to the theming engine to allow for easier import of theming functions and mixins, such as igx-color, igx-palette, igx-elevation, etc. To import the utilities do ```@import '~igniteui-angular/core/styles/themes/utilities';```

## 5.2.1
- `hammerjs` and `@types/hammerjs` are removed from `peerDependencies` and were added as `dependencies`. So if you are using Igniteui-Angular version 5.2.1 or above it is enough to run `npm install igniteui-angular` in your project for getting started. For more detailed information see [`Ignite UI for Angular Getting Started`](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/getting-started)
- `web-animations-js` is added as Peer Dependency.
- `Theming` bug fixes and improvements.
- Use the following command to generate `Ignite UI for Angular Themes` documentation - `npm run build:docs`. Navigate to `dist/docs/sass` and open `index.html` file.

## 5.2.0
- `igxForOf` directive added
    - `igxForOf` is now available as an alternative to `ngForOf` for templating large amounts of data. The `igxForOf` uses virtualization technology behind the scenes to optimize DOM rendering and memory consumption. Virtualization technology works similar to Paging by slicing the data into smaller chucks which are swapped from a container viewport while the user scrolls the data horizontally/vertically. The difference with the Paging is that virtualization mimics the natural behavior of the scrollbar.
- `igxToggle` and `igxToggleAction` directives added
    - `igxToggle` allows users to implement toggleable components/views (eg. dropdowns), while `igxToggleAction` can control the
      `igxToggle` directive. Refer to the official documentation for more information.
    - `igxToggle` requires `BrowserAnimationsModule` to be imported in your application.
- [`Ignite UI for Angular Theming`](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/themes.html) - comprehensive set of **Sass** functions and mixins will give the ability to easily style your entire application or only certain parts of it.
    - Previously bundled fonts, are now listed as external dependencies. You should supply both the [Material Icons](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/) and [Titillium Web](https://fonts.google.com/selection?selection.family=Titillium+Web:300,400,600,700) fonts yourself by either hosting or using CDN.
- `igx-grid` changes
    - The component now uses the new `igxForOf` directive to virtualize its content both vertically and horizontally dramatically improving performance for applications displaying large amounts of data.
    - Data-bound Input property `filtering` changed to `filterable`:

    ```html
    <igx-grid [data]="data">
        <igx-column [field]="'ReleaseDate'" [header]="'ReleaseDate'"
            [filterable]="true" dataType="date">
        </igx-column>
    </igx-grid>
    ```

    - @HostBinding `min-width` added to `IgxGridCellComponent` and `IgxGridHeaderCell`
    - The IgxGridCellComponent no longer has a value setter, but instead has an `update` modifier.

    ```html
    <ng-template igxCell let-cell="cell">
        {{ cell.update("newValue") }}
    </ng-template>
    ```
    - Class `IgxGridFiltering` renamed to `IgxGridFilteringComponent `
    - The grid filtering UI dropdowns are now controlled by the `igxToggle` directive.
      - Make sure to import `BrowserAnimationsModule` inside your application module as `igxToggle` uses animations for state transition.
    - `state` input
        - filtering expressions and sorting expressions provided

        <igx-list>
            <ng-template igxEmptyList>
                <p>My custom empty list template</p>
